Pulse oximetry is a method that is used to measure the oxygen level in the blood. The main idea behind pulse oximetry is that the blood absorbs the near-infrared light, the other light spectrum is mostly absorbed by the tissues. The amount of light absorbed various with the pulses from the heart (the arterial blood volume increases during systole and decreases during diastole) this variation in the amount of light can be detected using the photodetector which can be used for measuring the pulse.

In this experiment we will be using the IR Led, to transmit the IR light. By focusing this light on the finger, we also put the photodetector next to it. The amount of light reflected back is recorded using this photodetector. The signal from the photodetector is converted to the digital domain and processed using the microcontroller to report the final heart rate.

We explain the detailed implementation in the following sections. The system is able to detect the heart rate accurately, however, due to operating everything at lower frequency makes this system susceptible to the noise. We provide the algorithm along with the noise analysis at the end of the report. We will be improving this aspect of the system in the following milestone project.
